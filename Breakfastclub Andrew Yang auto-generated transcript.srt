3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,710

thank you

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,480
who is Andrew yang for people who don't
know all what do want me to start I'm an

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
entrepreneur who's spent the last six
and a half years running an organization

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,230
I started called venture for America
that helped create several thousand jobs
in Detroit Cleveland Baltimore st. Louis

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,219
Birmingham and other cities around the
country and I realized that the reason

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,129
why Donald Trump won the election there
are a lot of reasons they're a bunch of
them but one of the big ones is that we

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,399
automated away four million
manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,829
Pennsylvania Wisconsin Missouri Iowa all
the swing states he needed to win and my

13
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,010
friends in Silicon Valley and I've got a
lot of them know that what we did to the

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,670
manufacturing workers we're now gonna do
to the retail workers that call center

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,640
workers the fast-food workers the truck
drivers and on and on through the

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,330
economy
so I went to Washington was like hey

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,610
what are we gonna do about the fact that
when the third inning of the greatest

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,880
economic and technological
transformation in the history of the

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,729
country and the answers I got were
really disappointing too horrifying and

20
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,240
I worked in the Obama administration I
was a presidential or as I called the

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,619
the good White House and so a lot of
people I was talking to were Democrats

22
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,240
and for whatever reason no one wanted to
actually rise to this particular

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,780
challenge and so I'm running for
president to help us evolve in advance

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,079
to the next stage of our economy was a
lot of things that you said just now
number one it was the black house when

25
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,630
you was there okay cuz Obama was running
it but you wrote a book on the war on

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,219
normal people right here human jobs
that's a lot of people's fear so you see

27
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,189
that it's very scary but a lot of people
don't address it they act like

28
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,490
technology and automation is a great
thing and we're gonna hire people who

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,210
are gonna control the automation but in
reality a lot of people will be out of

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,879
jobs music coming like oh it's not just
coming it's already been happening and

31
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,410
if you look at the numbers
we lost four million manufacturing jobs

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,840
to automation over the last number of
years and if you go to Detroit or

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,650
Cleveland or st. Louis you see the
aftermath and I studied economics in

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,400
college and so according to economic
theory all those workers would get

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,540
retrained rescaled find new jobs and all
would be well but then when you actually

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,200
go to the communities you see that about
half of them left the workforce and

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,550
never worked again and of that group
about half filed for disability then you

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,130
saw a massive surge in alcohol use and
drug overdose oppression suicides and
depression and so there's a lot of

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,970
despair a lot of suffering and it's
going unaddressed around the country and
unfortunately it's just gonna ramp up so

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,380
one of the things I'm trying to tell
people is like look this is no longer

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,310
speculative this is not like oh we
should keep our eye on this this has

42
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,270
been ripping a hole in our communities
in our society for years now and it's

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,810
about to pick up steam so why a trump
support is worried about Mexicans who

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,270
need to be worried about the robots
taking the jobs that's my exact point

45
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,650
man it is not immigrants immigrants have
nothing to do with the economic distress

46
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,760
many Americans are feeling it's the fact
that technology is advancing to a point
where our labor is less and less central

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,960
to the economy so yeah what do we do
about that solution so the solution I'm

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,380
proposing and anyone who's heard about
my campaign knows this I'm proposing

49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,310
that we declare a dividend of $1,000 a
month for every American adult starting

50
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,270
at age 18 that's the universal basic
income yes the universal basic income

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,570
which I rebranded the freedom dividend
because it tests better with more
Americans with the word freedom in it

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,250
and so a lot of a lot of us have never
achieved true liberation in this country

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,310
yeah I mean it's a truth it's one reason
why Martin Luther King championed this

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,170
plan in principle in 1967 the year
before he was assassinated I called it
the guaranteed minimum income Thomas

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,810
Paine was 40 at the founding of the
country there's a very American idea so

56
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,780
it seems far out to us now that hey we
should just have a dividend where

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,010
everyone gets a thousand bucks a month
but we've been talking about this for

58
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,600
decades and it came this close to being
law in 1971 it actually passed the House

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,800
of Representatives twice under Richard
Nixon Milton Friedman and a thousand

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,550
economists signed a study saying
this would be great for America and then

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,060
one state has had a dividend for 37
years where everyone in that state gets

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,479
between 1 and 2 thousand dollars a year
no questions asked they did it that's

63
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,250
Alaska yeah you go to Alaska right now
you live there for a year and everyone

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,919
in your family gets between 1 and 2
thousand dollars a year from the

65
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,900
petroleum dividend it was past 37 years
ago by a Republican governor and Alaska

66
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,490
is a deep red state this Republican
governor shows up 1982 and he's like hey

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,520
there's a lot of oil money who would you
rather get it the government who's just

68
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,180
gonna screw it up or you the Alaskan
people and then the Alaskans said us

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,370
please and he's like I thought you'd say
that and suddenly they passed his

70
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,960
dividend and now it's wildly popular has
created thousands of jobs has improved

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,310
children's health as a decreased income
inequality and what I'm going around the

72
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,790
country saying is look what Alaska is
doing with oil money we can do for the

73
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,240
entire country
with technology money so what exactly is

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,169
the universal basic income the universal
basic income is a policy where every

75
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,830
everyone in a society gets a certain
amount of money free and clear to do

76
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,520
whatever they want no questions asked
can I ask you this if you make a decent

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,340
amount of money then you don't get that
universal basic income or do you get

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,760
that in addition to what you make oh you
get it in addition to what you make this

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,810
is a right of citizenship has nothing to
do with your income employment status

80
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:47,370
everyone gets it so you say technology
would yeah so right now and you guys see

81
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,139
that headlines Amazon paid zero in taxes
last year despite record profits Netflix

82
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,160
paid zero in taxes last year despite
record profits and it's not their fault

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,940
as just our systems really poorly
designed to have the American public

84
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,840
benefit from new innovations and
advances in technology and that's the

85
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,500
trap worried because I was just in Iowa
I'm sound very politician when I say

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,840
that shit but I was just in Iowa at a
truck stop and there were truck truckers

87
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,150
wall-to-wall and those jobs are exactly
the jobs that are going to be displaced

88
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,870
in the next five to ten years and so who
wins who wins from artificial

89
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,169
intelligence who wins from all the new
innovations it's going to be Amazon

90
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,740
Google uber Facebook the biggest tech
companies that will have the AI that

91
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,030
will then start displacing workers and
the American people will not see much
money from that at all adrià is selling

92
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,390
this all wrong
build a wall around Silicon

93
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,710
that's a question a load the wall it's
that but what made you want to run for

94
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,310
president is it the fact that Donald
Trump was an entrepreneur and made it in

95
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,640
or was it something that you were
looking at for a long time because we're

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,920
starting to see more and more
entrepreneurs people that don't

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,150
necessarily know or started in politics
really jump into the presidential
campaign I certainly would never be

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,940
running for president if a number of
things had not happened

99
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,870
the main one that Donald Trump won in
2016 so imagine being the guy who's

100
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,440
getting medals from the White House for
creating jobs around the country

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,320
realizing that your work is like pouring
water into a bathtub as a giant hole

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,850
ripped in the bottom Wow and that the
Middle's you're getting are nonsense

103
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,210
really like you're getting Pat's in the
back we're doing stuff that's not
actually gonna solve the problem and the

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,060
problem leads to Donald Trump and for
whatever reason no one wants to talk

105
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,600
about it and that's why I'm running for
president I'm a parent I've got two

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,100
young boys who are six and three and I'm
not gonna bring them up in a country

107
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,360
that's going to fall apart around them
which is right now where we are going to

108
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,560
go if we keep scapegoating immigrants
and people have nothing to do with the

109
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,770
problems we're experiencing instead of
focusing on the facts on the ground

110
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,100
which is that technology is driving our
economy to to you know to places that

111
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,670
it's never been why should I vote some
but for somebody with zero legislative

112
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,270
experience I feel like that's what the
mistake that we made this time not weak
that evil form but you know I was hoping

113
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,760
what I've been going around saying is
like look Donald Trump is a bad present

114
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,150
because he's a bad president you know
it's not like all entrepreneurs are

115
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,410
Donald Trump and as an entrepreneur most
entrepreneurs feel like Donald Trump

116
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,550
gives us all a bad name and he's more of
a marketing charlatan then he is a real

117
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,230
builder or someone who elevates people
and build strong teams and organizations

118
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,020
so it's up to the American people to
decide what kind of background they want

119
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,560
but I would suggest that the American
people have been casting about for some

120
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,649
kind of change agent for years because
we've sensed that our government is

121
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,810
falling way behind the curve he was
different so Donald Trump wins on that

122
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,770
but then you see Bernie Sanders achieve
outside success last time because again

123
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,120
people see that we need to make big
changes and even Barack Obama's election

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,870
in 2008 I voted for him twice
you can see the American people have

125
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,270
been hungry for some sort of accelerant
to help catch up and modernize our

126
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,410
government because we know Washington DC
is stuck decades in the past you know of

127
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,620
course you know being an entrepreneur
and I noticed that a lot of

128
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,640
entrepreneurs and a lot of people that
make a lot of money usually vote

129
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,990
Republican just because of the tax
breaks and things like that so why are

130
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,490
you voting towards Democrat or why are
you running as a Democrat opposed to

131
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,810
Republican which I would feel that most
entrepreneurs of people with some long
Bank are well if you look at my

132
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:35,230
background you know I mean I went to
Brown University so you know what they

133
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,990
went to brown and his brother went to
Wesleyan and I went to Wesleyan yeah

134
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,820
yeah but if you look at my my platform
it lines up with Democrat and

135
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,350
progressive priorities really across the
board on everything from reproductive

136
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,700
rights to to gay rights to gun safety to
everything else so it was very natural I

137
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,060
mean I was again part of the Obama
administration running as a Democrat was
very natural what what is your a

138
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,459
universal basic income plain how much do
you want to give a thousand a month
every every American adult gets a

139
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,550
thousand dollars a month starting at age
18 and that would be a game-changer for

140
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,990
tens of millions of American families
because we know 78 percent of Americans

141
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,500
are living paycheck to paycheck 57
percent can't afford an unexpected $500

142
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,010
bill and what I'm telling people's look
we have the money

143
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,760
like our economy's up to 20 trillion
dollars up five trillion in the last 12

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,520
years alone we're the richest most
advanced economy in the history of the

145
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,180
world we can easily afford $1,000 a
month yeah until I die

146
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,770
okay 64 well yeah it's until you die but
if you have Social Security than it

147
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,220
overlaps you don't get both inflation
no well not why not well I'll give you a

148
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,660
couple data points on the inflation so
we printed four trillion dollars for the
banks during the bailout and there was

149
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,370
no inflation in consumer goods and if
you look at what's happening right now

150
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,680
in your own life a lot of stuffs getting
cheaper or better that's electronics

151
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,730
clothing cars media food for the most
part all that stuff staying essentially

152
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,210
cost in a price or getting cheaper or
more sophisticated now what's going up

153
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:14,150
in price what's driving us all crazy
housing education health care and those
three three things are not being driven

154
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,790
by the fact that we've lots of money to
spend it's not being driven by like

155
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,380
purchasing power Healthcare is being
driven by the private insurance industry

156
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,100
and the fact you have this opaque
pricing and you're not actually you know

157
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,240
negotiating price for any interaction
education is because college has gone up

158
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
in price two hundred fifty percent and
families feel they have no choice but to

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,630
pay so they just take out massive loans
which is its own huge set of problems

160
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,720
that we have to try and address and I
would forgive a lot of student loans

161
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,200
because I think a lot of them were
immorally generated and it's a stimulus

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,920
to the economy young people should be
starting families buying homes starting
businesses and not paying off this

163
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,030
phantom student loan debt
sadly me yeah I I had 100 K in law

164
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,720
school debt for years I used to call it
my mistress I was like writing a check

165
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,090
every month to some like family in
another town like I hope they're in a

166
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,820
good time on so I get it like you know
people should not be just servicing this

167
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,230
loan forever it doesn't make any sense
and then housing housing is the

168
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,370
trickiest one housing is because we feel
like we have to live in certain areas in

169
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,240
order to access certain economic
opportunities so like the housing prices

170
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,680
in New York and San Francisco obviously
gone through the roof and part of that
is local part of that is zoning

171
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,020
ordinances and you can't develop
affordable housing but the point of it

172
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,800
is is that we're not increasing the
money supply by enough that you would

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,690
see massive inflation and the way most
consumer products work is that they'll

174
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,860
still be price sensitivity among
consumers and competition among firms

175
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,530
for your business there's no reason
you'd see a massive spike in prices you

176
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,410
don't think corporations would say ok I
know everybody's getting $1,000 and

177
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,670
whatnot so let's raise the prices a
little bit well then so on just regular

178
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,880
everyday products oh yeah so what I say
to people is like look let's say you're

179
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,920
you're in Missouri and then president
yang 2021 I'm like freedom vivid in time

180
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,070
let's do this thing and then the checks
are going out and then you're like the

181
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,650
burger joint and you're like ooh
everyone's got a thousand bucks a month
I'm gonna raise my burger prices from 5

182
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,750
bucks to 10 bucks if you walk in that
burger joint you're gonna be like what

183
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,020
the heck happened this is five bucks
last week and then you're gonna go to

184
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,550
the taco place of the deli and then
every restaurant has to try and go juice

185
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,029
Dainius Lee and then it just takes one
restaurant to be like you know what I'm

186
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,250
not doing that
I'm not doing that and then everyone

187
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,640
goes to that restaurant and then they're
all like oh I can't turns out I can't

188
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,740
stick it to people because it's not like
if you get a thousand bucks a month

189
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,110
you're all of a sudden made of money
yeah to get some basic things now what

190
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,250
about healthcare before you do that but
youyou said we have money when you said

191
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,970
we have a lot of money but a debt of
like sixteen trillion dollars that we

192
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,980
owe yeah so it's a little more than that
actually but so one thing I'm saying to

193
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,450
people's like look we have the money I
mean again Amazon paid zero taxes like

194
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,750
Jeff Bezos is worth 160 billion dollars
for a reason you know what I mean like

195
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:06,320
there's a lot of wealth in our society
right that's and it's gonna be good okay

196
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,880
so the fact that we've got a lot of past
mismanagement and a lot of waste in the

197
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
system does not mean we do not have the
money we have the money all right now

198
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,420
what about our universal health care do
you believe that along with this

199
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,839
universal basic income we should also
have universal health care oh yeah

200
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,709
hundred percent I'm for a single-payer
medicare-for-all it makes no sense to
have Americans more stressed out about

201
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,160
paying for care than we are getting well
if we get sick or injured or our kids

202
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,140
get sick or injured it's backwards it's
immoral and I'll tell you there's

203
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,209
another thing where people like where
you get the money where you gonna get

204
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,709
the money we spend eighteen percent of
GDP on our health care twice as much as

205
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,149
other countries two worst results we
have plenty of money it's just the

206
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:51,589
money's not on the public bottom line
yet but it should be so I've been the

207
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,040
CEO of a business I'll tell people very
honestly like our health care system
makes it harder to hire people it makes

208
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,320
it harder to treat people like full-time
employees because you just want to turn

209
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,300
them all into contractors and say hey it
makes it harder to start a business
makes it harder to change jobs it's

210
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,959
actually this giant impediment on our
economic dynamism and growth how many

211
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,459
people out there have businesses that
they might have started if our health

212
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:21,110
care was covered by the public sector
which it should be so so I'm for

213
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,760
universal in the future most people are
gonna be freelancers just because

214
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,910
companies are trying to just hire a
contractor so they don't have to pay for

215
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,160
health care
yeah ninety-four percent of the new jobs

216
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,740
created in this country since 2000
five have been temporary gig or contract

217
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,730
jobs so tying that don't have healthcare
benefits so tying health care to your

218
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,240
job makes less and less sense and we
just need to get with the program and

219
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,750
evolve and say look your job in
healthcare are unrelated yeah like you

220
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,910
said a lot of people don't want to take
that jump because they know if they

221
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,370
leave their nine-to-five they lose
health care and their family loses

222
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,830
health care I don't want to take that
job to be able to I'm gonna tell you

223
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,790
guys a true story like I told my wife I
was have opposed to I know I'm supposed
to everything else is I know this is

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,630
true story go to my wife and I say hey
Bea I'm gonna run for president and her

225
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:14,730
first question is what I'm gonna do
about health care DBI once said they

226
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,300
wanted to get rid of welfare and social
service program so wouldn't that leave
people who qualify for all these

227
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,620
benefits in like worse economic
positions because they'll have to pay

228
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,490
for their own health care and child care
and that is totally not my plan I mean

229
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,550
there there are people that have been
for ubi in the past who are like oh

230
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,150
we're gonna like get rid of all the
social services I think that's crazy you

231
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,870
can't take away programs that people are
literally relying upon for their day to

232
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,150
day a month a month survival it'd be
vastly destructive so my plan is to make

233
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,690
the freedom dividend available to
everyone and it's like a parallel

234
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,630
supplement to the existing program on
top of everything they're already
getting so what I'm saying is look

235
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,810
here's the freedom dividend if you opt
in then you're saying I prefer that to

236
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,800
other stuff so it's not that it's an
either/or but we don't take anything

237
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,890
from anyone so we're not gonna make
anyone worse off but if you opt into

238
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,220
this you're saying I would prefer a
thousand dollars cash unconditional no

239
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,430
reporting no monitoring no requirements
I can spend the money on whatever I want

240
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,820
no you know I would have to compare it
to what I'm already making in Social
Security

241
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,070
yeah yeah that's right and that's one of
the reasons why the cost for this come

242
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,289
down to something much more manageable
because a lot of people just do the

243
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,410
basic math and they're like twelve
thousand dollars for every adult in the

244
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,190
country that's like three trillion
dollars that's a lot but because of the

245
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,750
current spending it actually brings the
price tag down very very quickly and

246
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,470
then if you put on this tech tax where
we have a value-added tax that gets the

247
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,980
gains from all these new innovations and
self-driving cars and trucks like that

248
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,250
gets the price tag down very very fast
so this is much more affordable than

249
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,710
people think now how did you say that
you said that the money is

250
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,910
but then also read about the value at
attack so you want to put 10% on all

251
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,480
goods and services yeah what is it is
the money already there you have to put

252
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,540
the simple syntax on it in order to get
the money well so the reason why there

253
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,420
are all these people who are looking
like a OCR like very high marginal

254
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,440
income tax rate or Elizabeth Warren with
like a wealth tax like we realized that

255
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,620
this economy's gotten entirely
unbalanced where you have you know the
top 1% hoovering up all the gains like

256
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,810
when winner-take-all economy so the
question is how do you balance that out

257
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:18,660
and and so to me a value-added tax is a
much more efficient way to do it and

258
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,650
it's what every other country is already
done because a value-added tax is very

259
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,010
hard to game like if you're Jeff Bezos
your Amazon you're gonna have to pay it

260
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,730
as long as you're doing business in the
US so you could build the value out of

261
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,330
tax or to exempt certain consumer
staples so it falls more on on the

262
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,810
affluent than people who are just like
buying diapers and the rest of it but

263
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,980
the reason why every other country
that's an advanced economy aside from US

264
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,960
has already done it is that it actually
will get us a slice of every Amazon

265
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,430
transaction every Facebook ad every
Google search every robot truck mile and

266
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,420
bring it to the American people put the
money in our hands and then what are we

267
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,690
gonna do we're gonna spend that money in
the economy it's gonna create two plus

268
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,320
million jobs and Amazon and the gang are
still gonna get some of that money back
you know what I mean but at least it

269
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,600
comes through our hands we are the
owners and shareholders of this country

270
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,840
and this is a dividend for us now let me
ask you question now you talk about

271
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,160
Amazon and I'm down by the way you see
here Oh Marian is not my competition

272
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,020
Marian's awesome you talk about Amazon
with it we're not having tax but let's

273
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,980
say we decide to tax Amazon right
doesn't amazon close up go to a country

274
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,090
someplace where they get huge tax breaks
and then we lose all those jobs again

275
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,320
well again every other advanced economy
already has a value-added tax and

276
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,860
Europe's value-added taxes twice what
I'm proposing so where they gonna go

277
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,980
like we are the number one consumer
market it's how they gonna stop selling

278
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,690
here the other thing is that as
president I would make all of the tax

279
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,590
incentives provided by cities and states
for companies to move a hundred percent
taxable I would get rid of that stuff

280
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,130
because it makes no sense to have cities
and states fighting to give tax breaks

281
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,580
to the Amazons of the world we're from
the National point of view we don't care
what city or state they're in right and

282
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Amazon should be making
choices based upon what's best for their

283
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,450
business not who they can get the
biggest concessions from now you say in

284
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,000
a thousand dollars a month he's saying
free health care

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
now what about weed and what about
college is free college so yeah and

286
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,420
legalizing marijuana there's a lot of
money to be made from that as well so

287
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,640
don't you think about that and where
should that money go I'm for the

288
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,730
legalization of marijuana remove it from
the controlled substance list in part

289
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,050
because our administration of the
criminal laws are deeply racist it's

290
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,240
very obvious to everyone so on April
20th 2021 I'm gonna pardon everyone

291
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,230
who's in prison for a low-level
nonviolent drug offense I like your

292
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,890
marketing scratches the 4/20 baby
because it makes no sense to have people

293
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,670
in jail for stuff that's legal in some
parts of the country and then there'd be

294
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,060
a lot of money and and I know there are
bills that want to channel that money to
African American businesses and

295
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,410
communities which is a great idea yeah
because we were affected so much by

296
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,460
these marijuana laws yeah completely
there's Andrew yang have a black agenda

297
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,210
do you have an agenda specifically for
black people well a lot of it overlaps

298
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,130
with with my overall agenda cuz I think
that the you know the freedom dividend

299
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,940
and universal health care would go a
long way but I'm for getting rid of

300
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,760
private prisons I think it makes no
sense to have prisons that have a profit

301
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,150
motivation

302
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,690
oh I mean again it affects everyone yeah
I'm for dramatically increasing the

303
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,740
federal allotment HBCUs because the
problem with education right now is it's

304
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,000
become a business and so what happens is
schools and benefitting by catering to

305
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,300
the affluent because I'll donate more
money and they can pay full freight and

306
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,600
the rest of it and so you have these
HBCUs that are of an incredible

307
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,550
historical mission have been shown to
elevate you know hundreds of thousands

308
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,880
of African Americans but because they
don't have these crazy endowments that

309
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,870
some of the rich schools do that they're
struggling and so the federal government
can help shore that up the government in

310
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,520
my mind exists in part to counterbalance
the excesses and perversions of the

311
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,150
marketplace and right now in American
life the market is just running amok

312
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,960
it's over running everything and that's
what we have to stop and the one great

313
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,640
way to stop that get this dividend into
everyone's hands and that'll help us

314
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,360
we claim our democracy why would the top
1% of the country even just people
that's doing well in life need a extra

315
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,570
thousand dollars a month well should it
really be for universal should it really

316
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,840
be for everybody there are so there are
a few reasons why I think it should be

317
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,320
universal well one in this example is
like Jeff Bezos something I'm going to

318
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,590
be paying hundreds of millions billions
of dollars and do it so we don't care if

319
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,380
they get a thousand it's like you know
it's just like a reminder that there's

320
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,170
still a human being in a citizen but if
you try and make it income based it ends

321
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,530
up being a rich to poor transfer and
then it ends up being politicized in a

322
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,950
particular way more if you make it
Universal it's like look it's just

323
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,510
you're in America in your cities and you
get a thousand bucks a month and then

324
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,500
you end up getting rid of all the
administration you get rid of all the

325
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,160
reporting you get rid of all the oh my
circumstances changed or I'm gonna under

326
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,700
report because I want to be below this
line so I can get the money they get rid

327
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,570
of all of that stuff and then you get
rid of the stigma because one of the

328
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,440
problems with our existing programs is
that you know like there's a stigma

329
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
attached to being in them and then
everyone politically attacks them and

330
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,120
this you can't attack and Alaska is the
proof because in a deep red state
Alaskans love their dividend so much

331
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,420
that they said they would accept higher
taxes to keep the dividend that's how

332
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,350
much they loved it I see you're also
doing this plan with a couple of
families right you're testing it out to

333
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,000
show how it does work
yeah I'm personally giving a thousand

334
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,910
bucks a month to a family in New
Hampshire and a family in Iowa and

335
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:49,170
shocker they like it you know that money
oh yeah well if I'm president man I want

336
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,820
to do it for everyone and find the money

337
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,920
okay you would also be making four
million dollars a year as president so

338
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,650
I'm talking about his proposal oh yeah
so my proposals that presidents get a 10

339
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,120
X raise to 4 million dollars but then
they're not allowed to take any for
profit for personal gain speaking fees

340
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,900
or board opportunities or any of that
stuff after the fact because it's human

341
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,930
nature do they finish term is over oh
they can do books but they can't join

342
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,350
corporate boards for money do take
speaking fees for money
because it's human nature let's say I'm

343
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,120
president and then there's some rich
CEOs hanging around in the Oval Office
and I know that three years from now

344
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,159
they can give me four hundred thousand
dollars just to show up and smoothes

345
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,669
with their clients and employees it's
human nature for me to be a little nicer

346
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,220
to them be a little softer on them to be
like oh you know I should just make

347
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
friends with this person because I'm
gonna end up hanging out on the jet with

348
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,880
them after I'm president so you get rid
of that motivation you say look I can't

349
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,419
take a dime from anyone for personal
gain you're gonna pay me enough so that

350
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,169
you know I work for the people but
that's it we have to stop worshipping

351
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,909
the almighty dollar and that starts from
the top and this race can go into effect

352
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:06,419
the president after me I really do not
care we have to clean up our government

353
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,129
so it actually works for us and it's
clear that I'm with that cuz I feel like
presidents of public servants and I feel

354
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,690
like all public servants need to be
getting paid more money teachers police

355
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:23,399
officers I don't give more your ball
plays than you freaking like
entertainers watch it in the present get

356
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:35,759
formula yeah yeah and and and then say
no more profit taking after that still a

357
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,570
tough job sir
apparently I know my wife was reading

358
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,240
Michelle Obama's book and apparently the
account for like white house like

359
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:51,629
household expenses Stockton California
will be the first American city to

360
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:56,970
experiment with free money yeah I was
with mayor Tubbs on a panel just a few

361
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,519
months ago and you know I I think it's
tremendous that they're funding these

362
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,809
basic income trials in Stockton Mayor
Tom's a great guy I know some of the

363
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:09,570
people that are funding that trial but I
will say guys like this it's

364
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,970
embarrassing that a lot of the money for
these Charles is coming from private

365
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,470
individuals because coming in the 60s
and 70s the United States government was

366
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,490
giving money to thousands of American
families to test out whether this sort

367
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,700
of program works and it should be the
public sector leading the charge on this

368
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,779
because we're entering the age of AI
we're gonna have self-driving cars and

369
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,440
trucks in five to ten years 30% of malls
are gonna close in the next four years

370
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,250
thanks to Amazon two and a half million
call center workers in the US are going

371
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,529
to get replaced by AI there was a study
in The Guardian that said the the median

372
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,240
african-american household net worth is
going to be

373
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,549
by 2050 3 like in 34 years you guys see
that study no well yeah you should look

374
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,539
it up and so why are they forecasting
that african-american network and worth

375
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,350
is going to go to zero it's because of
this economic tidal wave that is coming

376
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,749
this economic tidal wave is gonna wipe
out many working-class jobs and it's

377
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:04,259
gonna be it's gonna be the equivalent of
a natural disaster and we know what

378
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,919
happens in a natural disaster who
suffers poor people don't have the

379
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,990
resources people of color and the same
thing is gonna happen in this so that's

380
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,379
why I'm running for president I can see
the tidal wave coming very very clearly

381
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:19,499
how do you why isn't what's different
between a welfare and government

382
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:24,570
assistance in you you yeah well the big
shift we have to make is instead of

383
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,899
seeing it as again like Oh like you're
down on your luck like things aren't

384
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:31,259
working out so here's something to get
you up to a certain point but then if

385
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,590
you do better we take it away like that
that's a way the way a lot of our

386
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,029
current programs are designed in the
dividend you get it you do better you

387
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:43,080
keep the dividend you keep what you're
making to it aligns your incentives much

388
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,269
more closely and again it gets rid of
the stigma it makes us all shareholders

389
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:52,200
of our collective progress and then if
someone comes up with some great

390
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,249
innovation you feel like okay at least
I'm getting a little piece of that and

391
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,450
then we can start having a better
attitude towards like our shared future

392
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,600
you know what I love about you Andrew I
love the fact that you're up here
discussing solutions and not problems

393
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:11,249
you're not running on a anti Trump
campaign you actually have ideas so that

394
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,940
it pains me that you probably don't have
a shot in hell of winning so are you oh

395
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,679
we're gonna find our brother I'm just
are you are you running to actually

396
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,139
Wayne are just to disrupt the system um
we raised almost 600 K last month which
is more than just about every major

397
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,389
candidate except for Bernie and no one's
heard of me so you gotta ask how the

398
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:35,490
heck did that happen I'm talking sense
and like you say and like you said well

399
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,220
I mean now thanks to you all like some
more people have heard of me which I'm

400
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,470
very happy for but you're right Trump is
a symptom what is the disease the

401
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,249
disease is the fact that we're getting
pushed into economic distress the

402
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:50,970
disease this is mindset of scarcity that
has overtaken our people because if you

403
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,530
can't pay your bills then it's very very
hard to be clear thinking and optimistic

404
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,550
the future the disease is increasingly
that we're going to be competing against

405
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,470
machines AI software robots that are
going to be able to outdo us in terms of

406
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,310
capital efficiency this is the disease
so how do you cure the actual disease

407
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,360
most politicians do not want to touch
this with a ten-foot pole because they

408
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,020
don't have real solutions and the
solution I'm gonna suggest is that we

409
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,480
share the bounty from all this economic
progress as fast as possible and that's

410
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,440
why I'm running for president build the
wall around Silicon Valley that has to

411
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,350
be your slogan you know you know what
about this what about this Lander you
know Donald Trump goes hard he will

412
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,710
slander everybody are you ready for that
you ready to get down dirty with the

413
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,270
shenanigans well we we joke around the H
cube what his nickname for me is gonna

414
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,190
be and we've come up with comrade yang
comrade yang why comrade yang you know

415
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,850
because it's a little bit like racially
tinged it makes me seem like this far
out socialist you know that sort of

416
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,720
thing and I'm looking forward to this I
mean these guys in Iowa came up to me

417
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,410
and they said I voted for Donald Trump
I'm gonna vote for you one person said

418
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,780
you're actually what I hope for when I
voted for Donald Trump Wow

419
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,680
so I can get some Trump supporters
behind me because I'm trying to address

420
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,130
the same problems that got him elected
but whereas his solutions were all

421
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,970
backwards it was like build the wall
turn the clock backwards bring back the

422
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,870
jobs I'm saying we have to turn the
clock forwards we have to accelerate our
society and our notions of our own value

423
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,610
and work and one of the examples I use
is my wife is at home with our two kids

424
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,840
six and three one of whom is autistic
and right now the market values her work

425
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,040
at zero GDP values her work at zero and
that's completely messed up we know the

426
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,250
work she's doing is more valuable and
difficult and important absolutely and

427
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,660
so we need to evolve in the way we see
value and this thousand dollar-a-month

428
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,770
dividend one of the things that would do
right now there are millions of American

429
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,070
women in exploitative or abusive jobs or
relationships because they lack the

430
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,190
economic freedom to actually make a
change in their situation so the

431
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,470
Democratic Party's going to talk about
empowering women you know it's gonna

432
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,710
empower women a thousand bucks a month
you know you get a thousand bucks a

433
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,550
month and then you know you're in some
job that's exploiting you or some like

434
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,810
you know relationship that's not good to
you then you are you the only candidate

435
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,510
that's believing in this universal
basically

436
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,110
I am the only candidate championing yet
thus far but I have a feeling I'm gonna

437
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,980
have some company after it sweeps the
nation everyone wakes up we're in a

438
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,280
democracy there's nothing stopping a
majority of us from declaring ourselves

439
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:29,030
a dividend nothing at all giving
ourselves some money it's yeah okay

440
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:35,250
declaring ourselves yeah so what happens
in like corporate language shareholders

441
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,880
get together and declare themselves a
dividend okay so this is what happens

442
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,660
with like Microsoft or coca-cola they're
like hey we're sitting on all this money

443
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,720
let's declare a dividend for ourselves
so what I'm saying is there's nothing

444
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,810
stopping the majority of citizens of a
country from declaring ourselves a

445
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,050
dividend there's nothing at all and
after people wake up to that reality

446
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,230
then it's gonna sweep the nation and
then I have a feeling a bunch of other

447
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,070
Democrats are gonna be like you know
what I'm kind of for that too but first

448
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,940
we need to make the case that this is
what we need to do as a people together

449
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm technology wise how do we keep up
but also make sure that people still
aren't losing their jobs to automation

450
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,660
to robots well and so this is really the
danger is that there's already a

451
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,110
reaction where some people are saying
look we need to outlaw robot trucks
because there's so many people that rely

452
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,450
upon that job there are three and a half
million truckers there another five

453
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,930
million Americans who work at truck
stops and hotels and diners that rely

454
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:29,040
upon the truckers getting out every day
and having a meal so it would be

455
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,910
disastrous to replace those truckers
with robots

456
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:40,170
in the next five to ten years but on the
other hand you're looking at accidents

457
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,700
that kill 4,000 people a year with human
truck drivers then you might be able to

458
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,600
reduce that number you're looking at
fuel efficiency savings because the
robot trucks can convoy together and

459
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,550
there's lower wind resistance so it's
actually good for the earth maybe if you
have robot trucks and all the stuff that

460
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,910
they're creating now right now my wife's
car I can't get into an accident I

461
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:13,980
cannot hit or miss a good karma vehicles
as well so what I'm saying is that where

462
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,750
America does not want to be in is in a
let's stop progress mode and we are

463
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,000
inching towards the let's stop progress
mode because I'm

464
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,330
I'll look up and be like wait is this
really what we want they're gonna be a

465
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,530
lot of truckers that protest robot
trucks 100% and only 13% of truck

466
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,730
drivers are unionized so there's no
collective negotiation at bargain most

467
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,100
of these truckers like small mom-and-pop
owned their own trucks etc etc and so

468
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,370
they're going to be protests and the
question is what are we doing as a

469
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,000
country so my plan is to say look this
is such a massive transition that we

470
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,420
should have a truck or transitions are
who takes some of the gains from where

471
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,040
about trucks and starts trying to create
a soft landing for displaced truckers

472
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,240
and the freedom dividend and trying to
reconstitute our economy as fast as we

473
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,900
can this is what pisses me off about the
a a conversation if robots are gonna

474
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,050
take over the world
let's just stop building them we're the
ones building the robots it's off switch

475
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,159
we keep building he's talking about the
benefits of having that because it will

476
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,970
cut down on other things like you said
accidents and better for the earth
better for the earth it's gonna save 168

477
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,899
billion dollars a year and so if you're
the United States and you're literally

478
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,669
like hey guys let's ban robot trucks and
then every other major economy has to

479
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,009
keep that you really are shooting
yourself in the foot you're like hey

480
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,800
we're literally gonna spend an extra
hundred sixty eight billion dollars to

481
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,879
maintain these trucker jobs and the
trucker jobs are really physically
demanding and brutal like 80% of the

482
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,090
trucker's have early markers for chronic
disease they're sitting in a truck

483
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:48,909
you know like eleven twelve hours a day
to make money yeah so this is the

484
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,750
question and this is and it's not just
the truckers man I mean like I saw what

485
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,629
happened the manufacturing workers what
happened to them is gonna happen to the

486
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,140
truckers we don't talk about it as much
but being a retail clerks the most

487
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,810
common job in this country even a tolls
and bridges there's no more there's no

488
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:08,980
real tolls and building the robots don't
hit the off switch or we just start

489
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,750
dispensing the bounty as fast as
possible and we start so if you imagine

490
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,100
a country after I'm president 2021
freedom dividend goes out what do you

491
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,960
see a massive increase in arts
creativity journalism entrepreneurship

492
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,370
volunteering participation in you know
nonprofits and religious organizations

493
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,870
like all that stuff's gonna surge after
you put twelve thousand dollars a year

494
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,950
into everyone's hands and so when you
talk about the meaning of life

495
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,140
Charlemagne I mean like I'm gonna
suggest that that that is the question

496
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,460
of this era like what are the truck
drivers gonna do yeah like that that is

497
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,970
the question and we have to start trying
to provide real answers instead of you
don't need a job you can't just say what

498
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,080
are they gonna do they go be is gonna be
hurt did a lot of people lot of people
are losing jobs now because it is real

499
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:04,690
bad just told well do you think that we
need to retrain people about technology

500
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,720
and learning how to code and learning
how to do other things to be more
advanced all right so this is something

501
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,410
I get really really animated about we
can talk about turning coal miners into
software engineers or whatever but the

502
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,410
reality is that if you're you know if
you're you've been a coal miner for 20

503
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,040
years or trucker for 12 years like
there's no reason to think that you're

504
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,460
gonna like being a software engineer or
that you can become a Kesava engine you

505
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,350
just might not be smart enough only 8%
of jobs are in STEM fields and 92% are

506
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,520
not so saying hey we're gonna somehow
turn the 92 percent into the 8% like

507
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,450
does not make any sense and the only
reason you're even trying is because

508
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,450
you're so brainwashed by the market
logic where you're like oh if you don't

509
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,950
have economic value then you have no
value and so because your job doesn't

510
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,190
work now I'm gonna have to turn you into
a coda or something which is ridiculous

511
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,690
on its face so we have to start valuing
ourselves intrinsically and design an

512
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,660
economy that actually works for human
beings to your point Charlemagne it's

513
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,480
like the kind of doesn't work for us
what's the point yeah so what we have to

514
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,260
do instead of measuring capital
efficiency and GDP we have to start

515
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,040
measuring things like childhood success
rates mental health and freedom from
substance abuse environmental quality

516
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,220
you know proportion of elderly that can
retire in quality circumstances this is
a way we actually measure the economy

517
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,920
before we invented GDP we ended vented
GDP almost 100 years ago during the

518
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,310
Great Depression and even the inventor
said is a terrible measurement for

519
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,250
national well-being we should not use it
as that and now we're gonna follow it

520
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,510
off a cliff so the big evolution is to
say look we're gonna value ourselves in

521
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,010
more human terms we're gonna build an
economy that works around us and then we

522
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,640
can start answering the the fundamental
challenges that got Donald Trump elected
now what about gun laws as far as gun

523
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:48,430
laws yeah so I'm a parent I think that
we need to treat gun owner

524
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,630
ship in a very similar way to the way we
treat vehicle ownership like look you

525
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,140
get a you get you have to take a test
and get a license to drive a vehicle and
that could kill people guns can kill

526
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,650
people too so we should give you some
kind of test and licensing for that too

527
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,820
the there's a hard part the challenge of
this is that there are 300 million farms

528
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,360
in this country it's like almost one for
every man woman and child and there are

529
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,650
limited ways you can actually try and
reduce that number so a couple things I

530
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,980
would do is I would have a voluntary gun
buyback anyone who wants to sell their

531
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,210
gun will buy it off you and I would also
offer to upgrade everyone's guns to

532
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,300
those signature guns where only you can
fire them turn everyone's gun into a

533
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,520
James Bond and then we're safer because
that gun goes to someone else and they

534
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,450
can't fire yeah and that that's
something it's actually not that

535
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:43,270
expensive to upgrade a gun to a
signature gun all the guns you know it's

536
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,610
a value of the gun but like I would say
that that's a win for the public and you

537
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,950
know that you sound like anyone's gonna
go and sell they're going all at once
but these are the sorts of things out

538
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,880
before I'm for trying to provide like
more positive alternatives than move our

539
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,370
society in the right way without
pretending frankly that we can just

540
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,450
regulate the heck out of everything and
so as an example of this our democracy

541
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,830
has gotten too overrun by corporate
money we can all see it and so a lot of

542
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,980
people like overturn Citizens United
which I agree with but what I would do

543
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,750
is I would give every American adult a
hundred democracy dollars that you can

544
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,900
only give it to a political candidate
every year and it's user loser you don't

545
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,050
use it it disappears you've got to turn
America into a monopoly and this would

546
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,230
like wash away the corporate money
because then if I get human beings

547
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,800
behind me I also get the money whereas
right now if I get the human beings

548
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,890
behind me I have to go someplace where
they're rich people and be like hey you
want to give me some money and it's the

549
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,230
worst like calling rich people for money
is soul-crushing so what you want to do

550
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,490
is you want to try and make it so that
if I get again real life Americans
behind me then they're like I like this

551
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,090
guy here's 50 democracy dollars and then
we human beings as if you're not one I

552
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,900
say for the past ten minutes one
interview really a robot pinch me

553
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,410
brother pinch me do that like I make
them real real nowadays
I'm very convinced no answer that and

554
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,329
even with taxes right you talked about
doing your taxes kind of like gaming

555
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:11,710
yeah so so when you think about so
running the government like a business

556
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,819
is nonsense they're two very different
things but one thing that the government

557
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:18,279
can learn from business is that
businesses don't treat their customers

558
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:22,779
like crap and our government treats us
like crap come tax day we're giving the

559
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:26,289
government hundreds of billions of
dollars and do we ever get like any kind

560
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:30,130
of like celebration of that fact I mean
if we're customers people would be like

561
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,220
oh my gosh it was like hundreds of
billions of dollars so I would make tax
day into a national holiday I would call

562
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,279
it revenue day I would have it so that
AI tries to pre-fill out your taxes for

563
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:42,430
you so if you're very simple taxes that
are based upon the same info it just

564
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,369
gets spit out for you and then you'd get
a video showing where your money's going

565
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:51,099
you know government employees thanking
you and then you can choose where to

566
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,609
send the last 1% of your money being
like you know what I really want to fund
these programs and then there'd be

567
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:59,140
someone from that program being like
well thank you for choosing this program

568
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,410
then you get Oprah and Tom Hanks and The
Rock in on this video and then we'd

569
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,130
actually not mind revenue day because
we'd be like oh and then I invite

570
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,049
families from every state to the White
House and celebrate our society's real

571
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:18,670
instead of treating tax day like this
thankless chore that we all dread oh

572
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,470
it's like oh you nut that America tell
me thank you my people fought here and
built this country for 400 freaking you

573
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,349
yeah let me think you want to activate
yes money you take it from me FICO yes

574
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,559
simple thank you you know we just saw
white there earlier every time that you

575
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,309
want to simple thank you yes yes no no
what about you know banking banking is

576
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,589
difficult especially in African
communities it's hard to get low
african-american that's African hard to

577
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,279
get loans what can we do to help people
get loans to spot to start small

578
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,490
businesses so there's the beauty of the
freedom dividend man cuz like money

579
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,339
follows money you know like if you have
african-american communities where

580
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:01,750
everyone's getting 12,000 bucks a year
then all of a sudden the businesses in

581
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,440
that community start being more
lucrative and profitable and then if I'm

582
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,320
a lender I'm like heck yes you want a
loan like sign me up

583
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,220
and then they'll start investing in
those communities because the market
will drive them in that direction and if

584
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,100
that doesn't work that will do more but
I think the Mar that like the best way

585
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,910
we can empower African American
businesses to put money into the hands

586
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,110
of African American I think to town I
think you should think mm you know the

587
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,780
best way to power African American
businesses put money in hands African

588
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,370
Americans yeah so I think you should do
$2,000 a month oh my gosh envy and we're
gonna we're gonna start with tube we're

589
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,690
gonna start we'll start with one and
then maybe my second term when

590
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:50,030
everyone's loving that first dividend I
I read Tana he see coats and I 100%

591
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,480
agree with the moral case for
reparations this country was built on

592
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,130
the backs of slaves and you know there
there's no two ways about it

593
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,270
so to me the question is what can we get
done there's nothing that we can do as a

594
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,750
society that would actually undo that
harm or I mean that right there there is

595
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:12,380
no redoing history but the path forward
to me if we put this dividend in place

596
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,200
and at least it starts strengthening
communities and then we can take real
steps forward towards hopefully again

597
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,500
can't make things right but hopefully
you can start moving things in the right

598
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,710
direction
